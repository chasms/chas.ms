"Let's Get It On" became Gaye's most successful single for Motown and one of his most well-known songs. With the help of the song's sexually explicit content, "Let's Get It On" helped give Gaye a reputation as a sex icon during its initial popularity. "Let's Get It On"" became the most commercially successful album of Gaye's recording career, and it further expanded his creative control during his tenure with Motown.
